The long-standing Agents at Aberdeen (A<sup>3</sup>) group undertakes research across several areas of multi-agent systems, focusing in particular on aspects related to resilience, reliability, and coordination. 
The A<sup>3</sup> research group is part of the department of Computing Science at the [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, located in the Meston building in the Old Aberdeen campus.

Agents research at Aberdeen has a long history, with work ranging from fundamental theoretical research on topics such as trust, norms and argumentation, to applications of such technologies. The figure below provides a general overview of the different research topics that the members of A<sup>3</sup> have been working on recently. While this word cloud illustrates some common topics of research among the group, it does not cover the entirety of the A<sup>3</sup>'s research portfolio.
