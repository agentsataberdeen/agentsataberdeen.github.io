abstract = {Trust mechanisms can allow an agent to identify the most trustworthy entity to which a task should be delegated. Now this entity may further delegate the task, ultimately resulting in a delegation chain representing the sub-delegation process. Such delegation chains present a problem for current trust evaluation mechanisms, as they typically which reward or penalise a single agent rather than sharing responsibility among all members of the delegation chain. As a result, decisions made on such incorrect trust values would not be optimal, leading to degraded system performance. In this paper we investigate the effects of sub-delegation on a probabilistic trust model and propose a model of weighting trust updates based on shared responsibility. We evaluate this model in the context of a simulated multi-agent system and describe how different weighting strategies can affect probabilistic trust updates when sub-delegation is possible.},

abstract="The exchange of goods and services between individuals is often formalised by a contract in which the parties establish norms to define what is expected of each one. Norms use deontic statements of obligation, prohibition, and permission, which may be in conflict. The task of manually detecting norm conflicts can be time--consuming and error-prone since contracts can be vast and complex. To automate such tasks, we develop an approach to identify potential conflicts between norms. We show the effectiveness of our approach and its individual components empirically using two publicly available corpora, and contribute with a new annotated test corpus for norm conflict identification.",

  abstract = {In order to facilitate the development of agent-based software, several
	agent programming languages and architectures, have been created.
	Plans in these architectures are often self-contained procedures
	with an associated \emph{triggering event} and \emph{a context condition},
	while any further information about the consequences of executing
	a plan is absent. However, agents designed using such an approach
	have limited flexibility at runtime, and rely on the designer's ability
	to foresee all relevant situations an agent might have to handle.
	In order to overcome this limitation, we have created AgentSpeak(PL),
	an interpreter capable of performing state-space planning to generate
	new high-level plans. As the planning module creates new plans, the
	plan library is expanded, improving performance over time. However,
	for new plans to be useful in the long run, it is critical that the
	\emph{context condition} associated with new plans is carefully generated.
	In this paper we describe a plan reuse technique aimed at improving
	an agent's runtime performance by deriving optimal context conditions
	for new plans, allowing an agent to reuse generated plans as much
	as possible.},

  abstract = {Societal rules, as exemplified by norms, aim to provide a degree of behavioural stability to multi-agent societies. Norms regulate a society using the deontic concepts of permissions, obligations and prohibitions to specify what can, must and must not occur in a society. Many implementations of normative systems assume various combinations of the following assumptions: that the set of norms is static and defined at design time; that agents joining a society are instantly informed of the complete set of norms; that the set of agents within a society does not change; and that all agents are aware of the existing norms. When any one of these assumptions is dropped, agents need a mechanism to identify the set of norms currently present within a society, or risk unwittingly violating the norms. In this paper, we develop a norm identification mechanism that uses a combination of parsing-based plan recognition and Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning mechanisms, which operates by analysing the actions performed by other agents. While our basic mechanism cannot learn in situations where norm violations take place, we describe an extension which is able to operate in the presence of violations.},

	Plans in these plan libraries are designed to achieve individual

	These restrictions, captured through \emph{norms}, include obligations,
	prohibitions, and permissions. Unlike traditional planning restrictions,
	norms can often be contradictory and impossible to achieve simultaneously,
	necessitating some form of compromise. In this paper we describe
	a technique for taking norms into consideration when deciding how
	to execute a plan. Our norms are constraint based, allowing for fine-grained
	control over actions. Our technique allows for reasoning about the
	interactions between norms, and resolves conflict by selecting actions
	where the cost of violating one set of norms is outweighed by the
	reward obtained in complying with another.},

In a competitive or even in a cooperative setting, an agent does not know for sure that its partners will successfully act on their part of the commitments. 
We introduce uncertainty into a successful recent approach of planning first-order commitment protocols. 
Probabilities reflect a semantics of the belief of an agent about the successful completion of tasks by other agents within the protocol, capturing notions of trust. 
We take a deterministic Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner, introduce probabilities into the task networks, and derive a protocol enactment which maximizes expected utility from the point of view of one agent.  We illustrate our approach on a business scenario in e-commerce.},

To address this challenge, we develop novel goal recognition approaches based on planning techniques that rely on planning landmarks. In automated planning, landmarks are properties (or actions) that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal. We show the applicability of a number of planning techniques with an emphasis on landmarks for goal recognition tasks in two settings: (1) we use the concept of landmarks to develop goal recognition heuristics; and (2) we develop a landmark-based filtering method to refine existing planning-based goal and plan recognition approaches. These recognition approaches are empirically evaluated in experiments over several classical planning domains. We show that our goal recognition approaches yield not only accuracy comparable to (and often higher than) other state-of-the-art techniques, but also result in substantially faster recognition time over existing techniques.},

In this paper, we propose goal recognition heuristics that rely on information from planning landmarks -- facts or actions that must occur if a plan is to achieve a goal when starting from some initial state. We develop two such heuristics: the first estimates goal completion by considering the ratio between achieved and extracted landmarks of a candidate goal, while the second takes into account how unique each landmark is among landmarks for all candidate goals. We empirically evaluate these heuristics over both standard goal/plan recognition problems, and a set of very large problems. We show that our heuristics can recognize goals more accurately, and run orders of magnitude faster, than the current state-of-the-art.},

Solving the problem of building indexes that truly optimize database access requires a substantial amount of database and domain knowledge, the lack of which often results in wasted space and memory for irrelevant indexes, possibly jeopardizing database performance for querying and certainly degrading performance for updating. 
We develop an architecture to solve the problem of automatically indexing a database by using reinforcement learning to optimize queries by indexing data throughout the lifetime of a database. 
In our experimental evaluation, our architecture shows superior performance compared to related work on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, maintaining near-optimal index configurations and efficiently scaling to large databases. }

Regardless of the underlying techniques, most plan recognition approaches are directly affected by the quality of the given observations. 
To mitigate such issue, we combine learning techniques and landmark extraction algorithms into an approach for plan recognition that compensates for noise and missing observations using prior data. 
We evaluate our approach in standard human-designed planning domains as well as domain theories automatically generated from real-world data. 
Our evaluation shows that our approach reliably computes correct plans in all domains of the experimental dataset, in both low observability problems and problems with noisy observation, outperforming approaches that rely exclusively on the domain theory.}

In this paper, we develop a method based on the \emph{operator-counting framework} that efficiently computes solutions that satisfy the observations and uses the information generated to solve goal recognition tasks. 
Our method reasons explicitly about both partial and noisy observations: estimating uncertainty for the former, and satisfying observations given the unreliability of the sensor for the latter. 
We evaluate our approach empirically over a large data set, analyzing its components on how each can impact the quality of the solutions. 
In general, our approach is superior to previous methods in terms of agreement ratio, accuracy, and spread. 
Finally, our approach paves the way for new research on \emph{combinatorial optimization} to solve goal recognition tasks.}

abstract = {Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) planning uses a decomposition process guided by domain knowledge to guide search towards a planning task.
While many HTN planners allow calls to external processes (e.g. to a simulator interface) during the decomposition process, this is a computationally expensive process, so planner implementations often use such calls in an ad-hoc way using very specialized domain knowledge to limit the number of calls. 
Conversely, the classical planners that are capable of using external calls (often called \textit{semantic attachments}) during planning are limited to generating a fixed number of ground operators at problem grounding time. 
We formalize \textit{Semantic Attachments} for HTN planning using semi coroutines, allowing such procedurally defined predicates to link the planning process to custom unifications outside of the planner, such as numerical results from a robotics simulator. 
The resulting planner then uses such coroutines as part of its backtracking mechanism to search through parallel dimensions of the state-space (e.g. through numeric variables).
We show empirically that our planner outperforms the state-of-the-art numeric planners in a number of domains using minimal extra domain knowledge.}

This model represents an abstraction of the actual environment, so it is necessarily incomplete and hence presents an issue for system verification. If the actual environment matches the model, then the verification is correct; however, if the environment falls outside the abstraction captured by the model, then we cannot guarantee that the system is well behaved. A solution to this problem consists in exploiting the model of the environment used for statically verifying the system’s behaviour and, if the verification succeeds, using it also for validating the model against the real environment via runtime verification. The article discusses this approach and demonstrates its feasibility by presenting its implementation on top of a framework integrating the Agent Java PathFinder model checker. A high-level Domain Specific Language is used to model the environment in a user-friendly way; the latter is then compiled to trace expressions for both static formal verification and runtime verification. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to two different case studies: an autonomous cruise control system and a simulation of the Mars Curiosity rover.},

We discuss the languages and tools used during the development of our team. Then, we summarise the main strategies that were carried over from our previous participation in the 14th edition and list the limitations (if any) of using these strategies in the latest contest edition. We also developed new strategies that were made specifically for the extended scenario: cartography (determining the size of the map); formal verification of the map merging protocol (to provide assurances that it works when increasing the number of agents); plan cache (efficiently scaling the number of planners); task achievement (forming groups of agents to achieve tasks); and bullies (agents that focus on stopping agents from the opposing team). Finally, we give a brief overview of our performance in the contest and discuss what we believe were our shortcomings.",

	abstract = {Food packaging plays a crucial part in the post-harvest environmental impact of fresh foods. Packaging is usually wrongly considered as additional economical and environmental costs. However, by minimizing food waste and losses, it could significantly contribute to decrease the overall environmental impact of the food itself. A good balance between environmental burden (resource consumption and additional waste management issues) and real benefit in usage condition (reduction of food losses) should be thus defined when dimensioning a packaging for a given application. Beyond food waste and environmental impact reduction, various kinds of considerations about packaging, sometimes conflicting, are generally expressed by the stakeholders (food and packaging industries, health authorities, consumers, waste management authority, etc.) related to safety, practicality, perceptions of the packaging material, etc. Therefore, to help the parties deciphering all these arguments, we designed an argumentation-based tool to take into account the conflicting preferences expressed. The requirements concerning packagings are modeled by several arguments provided by the stakeholders expressing their viewpoints and expertise. Based on a new attack relation, the argumentation tool computes sets of compatible arguments which are used to rank alternative packagings under debate. In this paper, we present a complete workflow implemented as a software prototype starting by defining a structured representation of experts arguments and poll results, and ending by a ranking of packaging solutions. We show and discuss the results obtained by the software on a use case study (fresh strawberries) to determine the justifiable choices between several packaging materials based on stakeholders' arguments.},

abstract = "We examined principles of graded argumentation semantics (independence, anonymity, void precedence, and maximality) to explore if (a) they realistically model human reasoning, (b) graphical representation of arguments facilitates compliance with the principles, (c) there is a positive correlation between compliance with di!erent principles, and (d) this compliance is related to cognitive re{"}ection, need for cognition and faith in intuition. Our results indicate that there are major di!erences in the compliance with the several argumentation principles studied in this paper. However, compliance with argumentation principles was consistently better and more consistent in the group presented with graphical representations. Moreover, cognitive re{"}ection correlated with compliance to some principles, but only in the graph group.",

	abstract="There have been many attempts to integrate automated planning and rational agents. Most of the research focuses on adding support directly within agent programming languages, such as those based on the Belief-Desire-Intention model, rather than using off-the-shelf planners. This approach is often believed to improve the computation time, which is a common requirement in real world applications. This paper shows that even in complex scenarios, such as in the Multi-Agent Programming Contest with 50 agents and a 4 s deadline for the agents to send actions to the server, it is possible to efficiently integrate agent languages with off-the-shelf automated planners. Based on the experience with this case study, the paper discusses advantages and disadvantages of decoupling the agents from the planners.",

abstract="Communication is a critical part of enabling multi-agent systems to cooperate. This means that applying formal methods to protocols governing communication within multi-agent systems provides useful confidence in its reliability. In this paper, we describe the formal verification of a complex communication protocol that coordinates agents merging maps of their environment. The protocol was used by the LFC team in the 2019 edition of the Multi-Agent Programming Contest (MAPC). Our specification of the protocol is written in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), which is a well-suited approach to specifying agent communication protocols due to its focus on concurrent communicating systems. We validate the specification's behaviour using scenarios where the correct behaviour is known, and verify that eventually all the maps have merged.",

abstract = {The advent of sophisticated robotics and AI technology makes sending humans into hazardous and distant environments to carry out inspections increasingly avoidable. Being able to send a robot, rather than a human, into a nuclear facility or deep space is very appealing. However, building these robotic systems is just the start and we still need to carry out a range of verification and validation tasks to ensure that the systems to be deployed are as safe and reliable as possible. Based on our experience across three research and innovation hubs within the UK’s “Robots for a Safer World” programme, we present an overview of the relevant techniques and challenges in this area. As the hubs are active across nuclear, offshore, and space environments, this gives a breadth of issues common to many inspection robots.},

abstract="Autonomy has been one of the most desirable features for robotic applications in recent years. This is evidenced by a recent surge of research in autonomous driving cars, strong government funding for research in robotics for extreme environments, and overall progress in service robots. Autonomous decision-making is often at the core of these systems, thus, it is important to be able to verify and validate properties that relate to the correct behaviour that is expected of the system. Our main contribution in this paper, is an interface for integrating BDI-based agents into robotic systems developed using ROS. We use the Gwendolen language to program our BDI agents and to make use of the AJPF model checker in order to verify properties related to the decision-making in the agent programs. Our case studies include 3D simulations using a simple autonomous patrolling behaviour of a TurtleBot, and multiple TurtleBots servicing a house that can cooperate with each other in case of failure.",

abstract="The Multi-Agent Programming Contest in 2018 expanded upon the Agents in the City scenario used in the 2016 and 2017 editions of the contest. In this scenario two teams compete to score points by building and attacking wells using realistic city maps from OpenStreetMap. Wells are the main addition to the new version of the scenario; they cost money to build and generate score overtime but can be dismantled by agents from the other team. This, along with other additions, made it a significantly more complex scenario than before. In this paper, we describe the strategies used by our team, highlighting our adaptations and new additions from our participation in the previous years. We have fully explored the use of all three programming dimensions (agent, environment, and organisation) available in JaCaMo, the multi-agent system development platform that we used to implement our team. Our agents were able to dynamically switch between organisational roles, allowing them to promptly respond to changes in the environment and different opponent strategies. We were the highest-scoring team in the contest and our multi-agent system turned out to be stable and robust in solving the difficult problems posed by the contest scenario.",

abstract = "We examined principles of graded argumentation semantics (independence, anonymity, void precedence, and maximality) to explore if (a) they realistically model human reasoning, (b) graphical representation of arguments facilitates compliance with the principles, (c) there is a positive correlation between compliance with di!erent principles, and (d) this compliance is related to cognitive re{"}ection, need for cognition and faith in intuition. Our results indicate that there are major di!erences in the compliance with the several argumentation principles studied in this paper. However, compliance with argumentation principles was consistently better and more consistent in the group presented with graphical representations. Moreover, cognitive re{"}ection correlated with compliance to some principles, but only in the graph group.",
